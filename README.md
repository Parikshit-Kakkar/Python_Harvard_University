Case Study: 
The movie dataset on which this case study is based is a database of 5000 movies cataloged by The Movie Database (TMDb) 
[Link: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata]. The information is available about each movie is its budget, revenue, rating, actors and actresses, etc. 
In this case study, I  used python on this dataset to determine whether any information about a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie. 
I also attempted to predict whether a movie's revenue will exceed its budget.

Other Approaches to the model are welcome through personal message. Much obliged to viewers.
